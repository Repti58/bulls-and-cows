## Dscription:
  ### The essence of the game: 
  The player is invited to guess the numbers that the computer guessed.
  The game has three difficulty levels (3, 4 or 5 numbers).
  In the input field, player can enter only the number of digits that corresponds to the level of difficulty.
  Numbers must not be repeated, other characters cannot be used, and input field must not be empty. Otherwise, the game will display an appropriate error message.
  After entering the numbers and pressing the "make a move" button, the game displays the result - the amount of bulls and cows (a cow - the figure is guessed, but not in its place, a bull - the figure is guessed and is in its place. The game continues until the player guesses all the numbers in the correct order. When the player guessed all the numbers, the game will congratulate and report the amount of attempts. In the "history" section, you can view the history of all games, including the date, difficulty and result. It also displays the best scores by amount of attempts.
